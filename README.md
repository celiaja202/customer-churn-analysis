# Customer Churn Analysis – Business Analytics Case Study

## Objective
To identify key drivers of customer churn and develop data-driven retention strategies using structured customer data.

## Dataset
- 7,043 customers
- Variables include Contract Type, Monthly Charges, Payment Method, Tenure, and Churn status.

## Key Findings
- Overall churn rate: 26.5%
- Month-to-month contracts exhibit 42.7% churn compared to 2.8% for two-year contracts.
- Churned customers pay on average 21% higher monthly charges (74.44 vs 61.27), suggesting pricing pressure contributes materially to attrition risk.

## Business Implications
- Incentivising longer-term contracts could significantly reduce attrition.
- Targeted retention offers for high-paying customers may improve customer lifetime value.

## Tools Used
Google Sheets (Pivot Tables, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization)

## Methodology
- Descriptive statistics and pivot table analysis
- Segment-based churn rate comparison
- Comparative mean analysis for pricing sensitivity

## Next Steps: logistic regression modelling planned
